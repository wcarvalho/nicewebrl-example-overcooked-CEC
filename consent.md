**Cross-Environment Cooperation**

This is a study from the paper [Cross-environment Cooperation Enables Zero-shot Multi-agent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12714), which explores how environment diversity can build agents capable of robust cooperation with humans.

In the experiment, you will be asked to play a cooperative game with an AI agent. The game will be displayed on a computer screen.

Can you guess which model is which?
